# Exploring the Correlation between Development Indicators and Happiness


As part of my Statistics course at university, I collaborated with my colleague @Matte-03 to explore the relationship between the economic performance of nations and its happiness. Specifically, we were interested in whether social or economic indicators were more relevant to the happiness levels of a nation. 

To explore the above mentioned topic, we applied a mulivariate linear regression, to see a) how accurate the indicators were in predicting the happiness levels of a country and b) which set of indicators, social or economic, were more accurate. To explore this, we used a data set from a large group of countries over several years. 

The detailed report is included in the repository.
